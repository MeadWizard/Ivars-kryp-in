I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, 
I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 
"We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal."

one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons 
of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat 
of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will 
not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor 
having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right 
down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys 
and white girls as sisters and brothers.
